# 🚀 30 Days of Cisco Packet Tracer Challenge

This repository contains my 30-day hands-on journey of learning **Computer Networking & CCNA** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

I created this challenge to master:
- Routing & Switching
- VLAN & Trunking
- IP Addressing & Subnetting
- DHCP & DNS
- Static & Dynamic Routing
- Network Security Basics
- Enterprise Network Design

---

## 🧠 Why This Repo?
Most students only watch videos.  
I focus on **real network building and troubleshooting**.

This repo proves:
- I can design networks
- I can configure routers & switches
- I can solve network issues
